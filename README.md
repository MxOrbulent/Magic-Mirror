# Magic-Mirror
A mod created by tired9494.
You can see a link to the original mod where it says "forked from".

My intended Changes:
Added durability to the magic mirror (TODO) (MAKE CONFIGUREABLE)

Added money cost per usage *requires a economy mod* (TODO) (MAKE CONFIGUREABLE)

The durability change is a entirely different item with the same recipe, players will simply recivie one or the other depending
on if you set durability to true.
